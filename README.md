# destilifes
<p><strong>CMS built on Node.js with a noSQL backend.</strong></p>

<p>Primary focus will be a framework for the display and management of the web applications of Joseph Montgomery and Steven Rose.</p>
<p>Secondary focus will include the ability to manage other content including images, videos, and audio.</p>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>Site will be a minimal responsive layout meant to display content with many variables. Goal is to create something that will manage various web applications and store appropriate data for each application.</p>
<p>Each site branched off of this build will begin with a home page. The home page will contain a blog or text page containing the manifesto or statement or musings of the artist. This page should be able to handle in-line images as well.</p> 

<h3>CONTENT AND MENUS</h3>
<p>Content will be stored in "flat-files." An administrator will be able to activate each flat-file drawer using queries. Queries will be based primarily on, but not limited to, taxonomy. Objects can be individually eliminated and arranged from queries.</p>
<p>The user will design the menu view based on the query results and number of queries they intend to use.</p>

<p><strong>Menu Example 1.</strong> The following describes a project site for the early stages of destilifes.com where each PROJECT is a different web application:</p> 
<p><strong>HOME | PROJECT 1 | PROJECT 2 | PROJECT 3| PROJECT 4 | CONTACT</strong></p>
<p><strong>Menu Example 2.</strong> The following describes the menu of a project site in the mature stages of destillifes.com where, along with PROJECTs, the authors wish to have other content queries (drawers) represented: </p>
<p><strong>HOME | PROJECTS </strong>: Project1 Project2 Project 3  <strong>| SCHEMATICS </strong>: Project1_Drawings Project2_Sitemap <strong>| CONTACT</strong></p>
